**Mission:** Become the #1 AI chat UI package in Flutter
**Timeline:** 90 days to market leadership
**Method:** Asymmetric warfare - be 10x better where it matters

---

## 📊 BATTLEFIELD ANALYSIS

### Current Market Reality

**Top Competitors:**
1. **dash_chat_2** (~200K downloads) - Simple but generic
2. **flutter_chat_ui** (~150K downloads) - Pretty but limited
3. **chat_composer** (~50K downloads) - Minimal approach
4. **stream_chat_flutter** (~45K downloads) - Enterprise play

**Your Position:** <10K downloads, comprehensive features, poor positioning

**The Opportunity:** NONE of them are built for AI chat

---

### Why You WILL Win

**1. AI is Exploding**
